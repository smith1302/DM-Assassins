	Matthew Gerstman

Dance Marathon at the University of Florida is a year-long effort that culminates in a 26.2-hour event where over 800 students stay awake and on their feet to symbolize the obstacles faced by children with serious illnesses or injuries. The event raises money for Shands Hospital for Children, your local Childrenâ€™s Miracle Network Hospital, in Gainesville, FL. Our contributions are used where they are needed the most, including, but not limited to, purchasing life-saving medial equipment, funding pediatric research, and purchasing diversionary activities for the kids.

<h1>Twitter Submissions</h1>
Want to see your idea posted when a player dies? You're in the right place. <br />
<br />
All of the tweets need to include the persons name to be worth it. <br /> When you want to insert someone's name into the submission include the text: "THEIRNAME" in all caps.<br />
THEIRNAME was killed in a tragic segway accident.<br />
THEIRNAME died from video game withdrawal.<br />
King Kong threw THEIRNAME off of a building.<br />
<br />
Also here's some other things to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
1) All submissions need to be under 130 characters so we can include the player's name in the tweet.<br />
2) Keep it PG. This one should be obvious.<br />
3) Since these will be tweeted, feel free to use #hashtags and @'s where appropriate.<br />
4) Spell-check is your friend.<br />
